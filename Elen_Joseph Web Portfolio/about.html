            <p>Do you believe in coincidence? A fun fact has truly happened to me.

                After losing my fiancé to cancer in April of 2009, I started a painting course in a Brazilian art gallery to feel relieved of my pain. Okay, I understand that part is not too fun…

                Anyway, at that time, I had never seen snow in my life but then I started painting a brown house with snow on its roof, a dry field behind it, and a tree in front of it.

                Almost seven years after I painted this picture, I met my husband in a language website from where we started dating. Because he lives in Canada and I was in Brazil, he sent me a picture of his house in winter time.

                I was shocked when I saw the picture. Surprisingly the picture of his house matches exactly the same with the house I painted in 2009. His house is brown, placed just in front of the Experimental Farm and there is a tree in front of it. When winter comes, it looks very similar to the house I painted 2009 full of snow on its roof and surroundings.

                We got married in 2014, and now every time when I see the snow I am so amazed.

                Is it just a coincidence?
